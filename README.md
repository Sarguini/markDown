# **Olivier Sarguini** *- in full professional retraining*



    Welcome to my Hub,

    I'm kind, respectful, a little tendentious and thirsty for knowledge.
    Formerly a house painter and advertising poster, here I am again towards my passion.
    The screens have been calling me since I left them in high school... after 20 years,
    it was time to answer them!
    
    My entry at BeCode opens the door to happiness and I'll be satiated!
